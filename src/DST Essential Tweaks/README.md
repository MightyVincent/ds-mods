# DST Essential Tweaks

This mod is mainly for my personal usage, aiming at integrating / modifying / fixing / optimizing some essential to me or abandoned mods.

## Features

1. Combat Trap Auto Reset (Inspired by [Auto Tooth Trap Reset](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=588560555))

    - Combat Traps will auto reset after a short delay
    - Works only on: Teeth Trap / Maxwell Teeth Trap / Bramble Trap (Won't affect Anenemy trap)

2. Catch Trap Can Reset (Inspired by [Trap Reset](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=679636739))

    - Catch Traps can be reset instead of picking up
    - Works only on: Trap / Bird Trap

3. Tent & Siesta Lean-to Uses Tweak (Inspired by [Infinite Tent Uses](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=356930882))

    - Can change uses from default value to infinite as you wish
    - When set to infinite, the uses will always be updated to the max value, instead of reduced

4. Really Invincible Companions

    - Some companions having a player as leader won't take any damage or attract monsters' attention
    - Meanwhile, they can still be interact with like storing items
    - They will become normal when they have no player leader (like when you drop the eye-bone on the ground), thus you can still complete the 'Murdered Chester' achievement in [DST Achievement](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1084023218))
    - Currently, works only on: Chest / Hutch (waiting to add others)
